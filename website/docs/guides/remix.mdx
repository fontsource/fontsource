## Remix

---

Remix is a full-stack JavaScript framework for building web applications. To import fonts into a Remix project, you can leverage the CSS bundler plugin built into the framework. Follow the steps below to set it up.

### 1. Install the plugin

<PackageManagerCode cmd="@remix-run/css-bundle" />

### 2. Configure the plugin

Modify `root.tsx` to include the following code:

```tsx
import { cssBundleHref } from "@remix-run/css-bundle";
import type { LinksFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

import "@fontsource-variable/open-sans/wght.css";

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    ...(cssBundleHref
      ? [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: cssBundleHref }]
      : []),
    // ...
  ];
};
```

> **Note:** You **MUST** include the `.css` extension when importing the file or you will get an error.

### 3. Usage

You can now use the imported fonts in your Remix.js project.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Open Sans Variable", sans-serif;
}
```

Read the official documentation on the plugin [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#css-bundling).
