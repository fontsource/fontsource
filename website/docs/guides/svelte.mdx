## Installation

---

To include Fontsource into your Svelte / SvelteKit project, it is required to import the font you are gonna use in your `+layout.svelte` file.

```html
<!--We are modifying the +layout.svelte file. -->
<script>
	import "@fontsource/open-sans"; // The font we are gonna serve with fontsource
</script>
```

After adding the import to +layout file, we are gonna add an `style` in the same `+layout.svelte` file the `body` selector, using the `global()` utility from Svelte:

```html
<!--We are modifying the +layout.svelte file. -->
<style>
	<!-- We use the global selector because Svelte.-- > :global(body) {
		font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
	}
</style>
```

> **Note:** This will modify all the font-family for all the elements.
