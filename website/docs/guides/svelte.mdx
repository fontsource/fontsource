## SvelteKit

---

To include Fontsource into your Svelte / SvelteKit project and apply it to your application's typography, follow the steps below.

### 1. Entry File

To apply the imported font to the typography of your Svelte / SvelteKit application, you can import the library into `+layout.svelte` file.

```html
<script>
  import "@fontsource-variable/open-sans";
</script>
```

### 2. Usage

To apply the imported font to the typography of your Svelte / SvelteKit application, you can modify the `body` selector within the `+layout.svelte` file.

```html
<!-- +layout.svelte -->
<script>
  import "@fontsource-variable/open-sans";
</script>

<style>
  :global(body) {
    font-family: "Open Sans Variable", sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

> **Note:** The font will be applied to all elements within your application's body. If you need to apply the font selectively, you can modify the CSS rules accordingly.
