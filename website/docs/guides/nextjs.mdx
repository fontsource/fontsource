# Next.js

---

To include Fontsource into your Next.js project, it is required to use a custom App component.
[Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

## Installation

---

It's as simple as importing it globally into `_app.jsx` or `_app.tsx`. Alternatively, you could choose to import it into a page component, however, the CSS will only be present within the page and not globally.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans/400.css";
import "@fontsource/open-sans/700.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```
