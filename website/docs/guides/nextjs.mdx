# Next.js

---

To include Fontsource into your Next.js project, it is required to use a custom App component.
[Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

## Installation

---

To add Fontsource to your Next.js project, you can import it globally in the custom `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` file. Alternatively, you can choose to import it into a specific page component, but the CSS will only be present within that page and not globally.

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/open-sans/wght.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```
