# Svelte.js / Svelte Kit

---


To include Fontsource into your Svelte / SvelteKit  project with Tailwind CSS, it is required to add the font you are gonna use (besides tailwind styles) in your +layout.

<CarbonAd />

## Installation

---

First you should install the font you want to use. For example let's use open sans:

```js
  yarn add @fontsource/open-sans // npm install @fontsource/open-sans
```

Then to include Fontsource into your Svelte / SvelteKit  project, it is required to add the font you are gonna use  in your +layout file.

```html
<script>
	import '@fontsource/open-sans'; // The font we are gonna serve with fontsource
</script>
```

After adding the import to +layout file, we are gonna add an `style` in the same `+layout` page the `body` selector, using the `global()` utility from Svelte:

```html
<style>
  :global(body){
     font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif
  }
</style>
```

And we are done 👍. 


> **Note:** This will modify all the font-family for all the elements.
