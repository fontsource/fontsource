# Qwik

---

To use Fontsource with a [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io) project, it is suggested to use the `/routes/layout.tsx` file. 

## Installation

---

Once you [install](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/install) the Fontsource package of your choice, you can import the chosen font variant into `routes/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import "@fontsource-variable/open-sans/wght.css";

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <Slot />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
});
```

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can import the font in **index.tsx** or any other component file and it should have the same effect.

## Usage  

---

You can now use the imported fonts in your Qwik City project. Here's an example of the Open Sans Variable font being applied to an `h1` selector.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Open Sans Variable", sans-serif;
}
```

### Scoped Component Fonts

To use Qwik's scoped CSS functionality, you can use the font declaration in the `useStylesScoped$()` hook from Qwik. 

```tsx
import { component$, useStylesScoped$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import "@fontsource/open-sans/500.css";

export default component$(() => {
  useStylesScoped$(`
      .heading {
        font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
        font-weight: 500;
      }
    `);
  return (
    <>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Scoped heading using Open Sans with 500 font weight!
        </h1>
    </>
  );
});
```

You can opt out of this scoped behavior by using Qwik's `:global()` selector.

### Extensibility

By default, Qwik works well with Fontsource out of the box. This even includes [lazy-loadable references](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/styles/#usestyles) to component styles with `useStyles$()`.
