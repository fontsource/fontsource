# Getting Started

---

Fontsource supports a variety of import methods. It either assumes you are using a bundler, such as Webpack, to load in CSS, or using Sass mixins which is explained [here](/docs/sass/mixins).

## Quick Installation

---

This is an installation example using Open Sans, applicable to all other fonts searchable via the [directory](/fonts).

```js
  yarn add @fontsource/open-sans // npm install @fontsource/open-sans
```

Then within your app entry file, page or site component, import it in. E.g. `_app.jsx` or `index.jsx` etc.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans"; // Defaults to weight 400 with normal variant.
```

Fontsource allows you to select weights and even individual styles, allowing you to cut down on payload sizes to the last byte! Utilizing the CSS [`unicode-range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) selector, all language subsets are accounted for.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans/500.css"; // Weight 500.
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900-italic.css"; // Italic variant.
```

> **Note:** The range of supported weights and styles a font may support is shown in each directory listing or package README.

Once imported, you can reference the font name in a CSS stylesheet, CSS Module, or CSS-in-JS.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
}
```

If your chosen font supports variable fonts, it is highly recommended to use it when working with multiple weights for smaller bundle sizes. Learn more [here](/docs/variable-fonts).
