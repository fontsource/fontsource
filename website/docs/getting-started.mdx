# Installation

Fontsource supports a variety of import methods.

Fontsource assumes you are using a bundler, such as Webpack, to load in CSS. Solutions like [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) are prebuilt examples that are compatible.

This is an installation example using Open Sans, applicable to all other fonts searchable via NPM or the packages directory.

<CodeBlock>
  yarn add @fontsource/open-sans // npm install @fontsource/open-sans
</CodeBlock>

Then within your app entry file or site component, import it in. For example in Gatsby, you could choose to import it into a layout template (`layout.js`), page component (`index.js`), or `gatsby-browser.js`.

<CodeBlock>
  import "@fontsource/open-sans"; // Defaults to weight 400 with normal variant.
</CodeBlock>

Fontsource allows you to select weights and even individual styles, allowing you to cut down on payload sizes to the last byte! Utilizing the CSS unicode-range selector, all language subsets are accounted for.

```javascript
import "@fontsource/open-sans/500.css"; // Weight 500.
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900-italic.css"; // Italic variant.
```

Alternatively, the same solutions could be imported via SCSS!

```scss
@import "~@fontsource/open-sans/index.css";
@import "~@fontsource/open-sans/300-italic.css";
```
