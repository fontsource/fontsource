# Material Icons

---

Fontsource does support all the variations of [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons). More details on how to use the font variation of the project can be found [here](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web).

## Installation

---

Install the font as usual like any other Fontsource package using the package manager of your choice, then import the project.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/material-icons";
import "@fontsource/material-icons-rounded";
import "@fontsource/material-icons-outlined";
import "@fontsource/material-icons-sharp";
import "@fontsource/material-icons-two-tone";
```

Within the CSS files included in the import is the `.material-icons` class which contains all the necessary rules to render the icons.

To then incorporate it into your web page, all you need to do is specify it in your HTML.

```html
<span class="material-icons">face</span>
```
