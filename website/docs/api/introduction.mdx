# About

---

The Fontsource API allows developers to query information about fonts which the repository supports.

> **Note:** The API servers are kindly sponsored by our friends at [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). We recommend using them as other CDNs may impose restrictions due to certain package sizes exceeding their limits.

## Usage

---

The URL to access the API is found at [`api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts`](https://api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts).

Each route can also have additional queries included with the URL to filter the responses appropriately.

For example, [`api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts?subsets=latin,latin-ext&variable=true`](https://api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts?subsets=latin,latin-ext&variable=true) will return fonts that match subsets `latin` and `latin-ext` as well as if it is a variable font.
