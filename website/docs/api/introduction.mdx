## Introduction

---

The Fontsource API provides developers with access to information about the fonts supported by the Fontsource repository.

> **Note:** The API servers are generously sponsored by [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). We recommend using them as other CDNs may impose restrictions due to certain package sizes exceeding their limits.

## Usage

---

To access the Fontsource API, you can use the following URL: [`api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts`](https://api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts).

You can include additional queries in the URL to filter the responses based on specific criteria. For example, [`api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts?subsets=latin,latin-ext&variable=true`](https://api.fontsource.org/v1/fonts?subsets=latin,latin-ext&variable=true) will return fonts that match subsets `latin` and `latin-ext`, as well as if it is a variable font.

## Contents
