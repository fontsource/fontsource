## Variable Fonts

Variable fonts allow designers and developers to use a single font file that contains multiple variations of the same font, such as different weights, widths, and styles. This can result in **smaller file sizes** and **more flexible design options**. Here's how you can use variable fonts with Fontsource:

### 1. Install Package

To use a variable font with Fontsource, you need to install the corresponding variable font package. For example, if you want to use the Roboto Flex variable font, you would install the `@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex` package:

```sh
npm install @fontsource-variable/roboto-flex
```

### 2. Import the Font

After installing the package, you can import the font into your project like this:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex"; // Supports weights 100-900 in a single small file.
```

This will import the standard weight of the font. If you want to use a specific weight or variation, you can import the corresponding CSS file instead:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/wght-ital.css"; // Supports weights 100-900 and italic style
```

### 3. CSS

Once the font is imported, you can use it in your CSS stylesheets just like any other font. The difference with variable fonts is that you can specify the specific axis values you want to use. Here's an example:

```css
body {
	font-family: "Roboto Flex", sans-serif;
	font-weight: 500;
	font-variation-settings: "wdth" 75, "wght" 500;
}
```

In this example, we are setting the font weight to 500 and the width axis to 75% of the maximum width. Note that not all axes are supported by all variable fonts, so you will need to consult the font documentation to see which axes are available.

## Axes

The default installation covers all weights.
