## Variable Fonts

---

Variable fonts allow designers and developers to use a single font file that contains multiple variations of the same font, such as different weights, widths, and styles. This can result in **smaller file sizes** and **more flexible design options**. Here's how you can use variable fonts with Fontsource:

### 1. Install Package

To use a variable font with Fontsource, you need to install the corresponding variable font package. For example, if you want to use the Roboto Flex variable font, you would install the `@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex` package:

<PackageManagerCode cmd="@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex" />

### 2. Import the Font

After installing the package, you can import the font into your project like this:

```jsx
// Supports weights 100-900 in a single small file.
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex";
```

This will import the standard weight of the font. If you want to use a specific weight or variation, you can import the corresponding CSS file instead:

```jsx
// Supports weights 100-900 in italic style.
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/wght-italic.css";
```

### 3. CSS

Once the font is imported, you can use it in your CSS stylesheets just like any other font. The difference with variable fonts is that you can specify the specific axis values you want to use. Here's an example:

```css
body {
    font-family: "Roboto Flex Variable", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 500;
    font-variation-settings: "wdth" 75, "wght" 500;
}
```

In this example, we are setting the font weight to 500 and the width axis to 75% of the maximum width. Note that not all axes are supported by all variable fonts, so you will need to consult the font documentation to see which axes are available.

### 4. Fallbacks

Optionally, if you want to use variable fonts but also support browsers that do not support them, you can use the `@supports` rule to provide a fallback. You will also need to import `@fontsource/roboto-flex` or any other font as the fallback, however, it is also fine to rely on default system fonts for this. Here's an example:

```css
body {
    font-family: "Roboto Flex", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 500;
}

@supports (font-variation-settings: normal) {
    body {
        font-family: "Roboto Flex Variable", sans-serif;
        font-weight: 500;
        font-variation-settings: "wdth" 75, "wght" 500;
    }
}
```

This will only apply the font styles if the browser supports variable fonts (`font-variation-settings`). Otherwise, it will use the fallback font.

## Understanding Variable Axes

Variable axes in fonts refer to the ability to adjust various visual characteristics of a font along a continuous spectrum. This allows for greater flexibility and control in fine-tuning the appearance of typography. Fontsource, a font provider, supports variable axes in its fonts, enabling users to leverage these customizable options for their design needs.

#####

Fontsource's variable axes encompass a range of standard and custom options. The standard axes include:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/wght.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/wdth-italic.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/slnt.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/opsz-italic.css";
```

> **Note:** Every import includes the `wght` axis as multiple imports of different axes are not supported. You **must** use a single import when importing variable fonts.

If you are using multiple of the above axes, you can import them all at once using the `standard` CSS file:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/standard.css";
```

In addition to these standard axes, Fontsource also provides support for specific custom axes, such as:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/grad.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/ytuc.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/xtra.css";
```

> **Note:** The above axes are not supported by all fonts. Please refer to the font page in the search directory to see which axes are available.

These custom axes offer additional opportunities for fine-grained customization beyond the standard options, providing more specialized variations. If you want to import **all** available axes, you can use the `full` CSS file:

```jsx
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/full.css";
```

By leveraging Fontsource's variable axes, designers and developers can precisely tailor the visual attributes of fonts, achieving the desired typographic effect and enhancing the overall aesthetic of their projects.
