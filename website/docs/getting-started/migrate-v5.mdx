## Migration Guide V5

---

Fontsource v5 introduces several breaking changes that may require modifications to your existing codebase. This guide will help you migrate from the previous version to the latest version of Fontsource. Please review the following breaking changes and apply the necessary updates.

## Breaking Changes

---

### Variable Font Package Names

Variable fonts are now split into separate packages to provide more flexibility and granular control.

#### Before

```js
import "@fontsource/roboto-flex/variable.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto-flex/variable-italic.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto-flex/variable-full.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto-flex/variable-full-italic.css";
```

#### After

```js
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/wght-ital.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/full.css";
import "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex/full-ital.css";
```

### Variable Font Family Names

A mistake made the `font-family` names for variable fonts inconsistent with the rest of the packages. This has been fixed in v5, so you will need to update your CSS stylesheets.

#### Before

```css
body {
	font-family: "Roboto FlexVariable", sans-serif;
}
```

#### After

```css
body {
	font-family: "Roboto Flex Variable", sans-serif;
}
```

### Rewritten Sass Integration

The Sass integration in Fontsource has been completely rewritten in version 5. Please refer to the new Sass documentation for detailed usage instructions as there are many changes. Here's a small example to showcase the difference:

#### Before

```scss
@include OpenSans.fontFace(
  $weight: 500,
  $display: fallback,
  $fontDir: "~@fontsource/open-sans/files"
);
```

#### After

```scss
@include OpenSans.faces(
  $subsets: latin,
  $weights: 500,
  $styles: italic
);
```

### License Metadata

A small change to the `metadata.json` file changes the `license` property from type `string` to an a new license object. This is to store more relevant information to font licenses.

#### Before

```json
{
  ...
  "license": "https://fonts.google.com/attribution",
  ...
}
```

#### After

```json
{
  ...
  "license": {
    "type": "OFL-1.1",
    "url": "http://scripts.sil.org/OFL",
    "attribution": "Copyright <attribution>"
  },
  ...
}
```
