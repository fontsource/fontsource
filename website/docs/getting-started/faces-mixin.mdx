# Faces Mixin

The Faces mixin in Fontsource allows you to generate a highly customizable CSS file for your font by modifying various [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) variables. This guide explains how to use the Faces mixin in your Sass/SCSS projects.

## Installation

To use the Faces mixin, you need to import the mixin file from the specific font package. Here's an example for the Open Sans font:

```scss
@use "pkg:@fontsource-utils/scss" as fontsource;
@use "pkg:@fontsource-variable/recursive/scss" as recursive;
```

> **Note:** Make sure to adjust the import path and the name alias (as) according to the font package you are using.

## Usage

Once you have imported the mixin, you can use it to generate a CSS file with customized font variations. Here's an example that generates a CSS file similar to `recursive/latin-500-italic.css`:

```scss
@include fontsource.faces(
  $metadata: recursive.$metadata,
  $subsets: latin,
  $weights: 500,
  $styles: italic
);
```

You can customize the font variations by specifying different subsets, weights, and styles. Use the all option if you want to include all available options for a specific property. Here's an example that includes multiple subsets, weights, and all available styles:

```scss
@include fontsource.faces(
  $metadata: recursive.$metadata,
  $subsets: (
    latin,
    greek,
  ),
  $weights: (
    300,
    400,
    800,
  ),
  $styles: all
);
```

### Mixin Arguments

The Faces mixin accepts several properties as arguments, allowing you to customize various aspects of the font. Here are the available arguments::

| Variable | Description                                                                                                                                       | Options                                                                         | Default                                  |

| $weights | List of included weights (see [font-weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-weight))                             | `all`, or any of the weights listed for the font                                | Metadata default used (e.g. 400)         |

| Variable   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default                                                    |

| $directory | Base directory used for the font source paths                                                                                                                                                     | Default package path (e.g. `~@fontsource/open-sans/files`) |

### Global Configuration

The arguments for the Faces mixin can also be set directly on module import, which will set the new defaults throughout different uses of the mixin. Here's an example:

```scss
@use "@fontsource-utils/scss" as fontsource with (
  $weights: (
    300,
    700,
  ),
  $family: "Fontsource Custom"
);

@include fontsource.faces(
  $metadata: recursive.$metadata
  // The global configuration can still be overwritten through arguments
  $family: "Recursive Other"
);
```

By setting the arguments on module import, you can easily configure the defaults for the Faces mixin.
