## Install

---

Fontsource assumes you are using a bundler, such as Vite or Webpack to handle importing CSS into your final bundle. Please refer to Guides to see if your framework of choice is supported.

This project also supports the use of Sass mixins which is explained [here](/docs/getting-started/faces-mixin).

### Variable Fonts

If your chosen font supports variable fonts, we highly recommend using it when working with multiple weights for smaller bundle sizes. Learn more here.

### Default Installation

---

To install a font from Fontsource, use a package manager of choice to install the package. For example, to install Open Sans:

<PackageManagerCode cmd="@fontsource/open-sans" />

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can download the font files yourself on each directory listing.

Next, import the font in your application entry file, page, or site component. For example, in \_app.jsx or index.jsx:

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans"; // Defaults to weight 400 with normal variant.
```

You can also choose specific weights and styles to import, which can reduce the payload size even further. To import a specific weight or style, use the corresponding CSS file:

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans/500.css"; // Weight 500.
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900-italic.css"; // Italic variant.
```

> **Note:** Each font package will provide information on the supported weights and styles in the directory listing or package README.

Once you have imported the font, you can reference it in a CSS stylesheet, CSS Module, or CSS-in-JS:

```css
body {
	font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
```
