# Install

Fontsource provides a straightforward process for installing fonts into your web application. This guide will walk you through the installation steps.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you are using a bundler, such as Vite or Webpack, to handle importing CSS into your final bundle. Please refer to the [Fontsource Guides](/docs/guides) section to see detailed instructions for your preferred framework.

> **Variable Fonts**
>
> If your chosen font supports variable fonts, Fontsource **highly recommends** using them, especially when working with multiple weights, as it helps reduce bundle sizes. To learn more about using variable fonts, refer to the dedicated [Variable Fonts](/docs/getting-started/variable) guide.

## Setup

To install a font from Fontsource, follow the steps below.

### 1. Choose a Package

Select the font package you wish to install. Each font package corresponds to a specific font.

### 2. Install the Package

Use your preferred package manager to install the font package. For example, to install the Open Sans font, run the following command:

<PackageManagerCode cmd="@fontsource/open-sans" />

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can download the font files yourself in each directory listing.

### 3. Import the Font

In your application's entry file, page, or site component, import the font package. The import method determines which font files are included.

#### Default Import

The most straightforward way to import a font is using its package name directly. This will import the most common weight, which is **400** for most fonts.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans"; // Defaults to weight 400.
```

#### Specific Weights and Styles

To minimize your bundle size, it is recommended to import only the specific weights and styles you need. A single import statement will load **one** font file.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans/300.css"; // Includes weight 300.
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900-italic.css"; // Includes weight 900 in italic style.
```


If you need both a regular and an italic style for the same weight, you'll need two separate imports. The import for a normal style **does not** include its italic variant.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900.css"; // Includes weight 900.
import "@fontsource/open-sans/900-italic.css"; // Includes weight 900 in italic style.
```

If you need to use **all** available weights and styles, you must import each one individually. Due to the large file size, this is generally not recommended unless you have a specific use case.

> **Note:** Each font package will provide information on the supported weights and styles in the directory listing or package README.

### 4. TypeScript Configuration

If you're using TypeScript, you may encounter errors when importing CSS files due to TypeScript's [`noUncheckedSideEffects`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports) flag. To resolve this, add ambient module declarations to your project.

Create a global TypeScript declaration file (e.g., `src/globals.d.ts`) and include the following:

```ts
// ./src/globals.d.ts
declare module "*.css";
declare module "@fontsource/*" {}
declare module "@fontsource-variable/*" {}
```

This tells TypeScript to allow imports from CSS files and Fontsource packages without type checking.

> **Note:** If you're using a bundler like **Vite** or a framework that handles CSS imports automatically, you likely won't need to do this.

### 5. CSS

Once the font is imported, you can reference it in your CSS stylesheets, CSS Modules, or CSS-in-JS using the font family name.

```css
body {
 font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
```

That's it! You have successfully installed and imported a font from Fontsource into your web application.
