# Introduction

When using Fontsource in a Sass/SCSS project, you will need to configure your Sass compiler to resolve the [`pkg:`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/#pkg-ur-ls) import directive to resolve the font stylesheets from the NPM package.

## Configuration

It is required to use Dart Sass `v1.71.0` or later to resolve the [`pkg:`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/#pkg-ur-ls) import directive.

### Command Line

If you are using the command line to compile your Sass files, you can use the [`--pkg-importer=node`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#pkg-importer-node) flag to resolve the imports. Here's an example of how to compile a Sass file using the command line flag:

```bash
sass --pkg-importer=node style.scss style.css
```

### JavaScript API

If you are using the JavaScript API to compile your Sass files, you can use the [`NodePackageImporter()`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/classes/nodepackageimporter/) to resolve the imports. Here's an example of how to configure the Sass compiler:

```javascript
const sass = require('sass');

sass.compileString('@use "pkg:@fontsource-variable/roboto', {
  importers: [new sass.NodePackageImporter()]
});
```

### Direct URLs

If you cannot use the `pkg:` import directive, you can still import the Fontsource stylesheets using the direct URI to the CSS file. Here's an example of importing the Open Sans font using the direct URL:

```scss
// Adjust path as necessary.
@use "../node_modules/@fontsource-utils/src/mixins.scss" as fontsource;
@use "../node_modules/@fontsource-variable/recursive/scss/metadata.scss" as recursive;
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can import Fontsource stylesheets using the `@use` rule in your Sass/SCSS files.

For more advanced usage, you can use the mixins to generate a highly customizable CSS file for your font.
