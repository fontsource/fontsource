The CSS and web font files to easily self-host the “Combo” font. Please visit the main [Fontsource monorepo](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource) to view more details on this package.

## Installation

Fontsource assumes you are using a bundler, such as Webpack, to load in CSS. Solutions like [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) are prebuilt examples that are compatible.

```javascript
yarn add @fontsource/combo // npm install @fontsource/combo
```

Then within your app entry file or site component, import it in. For example in Gatsby, you could choose to import it into a layout template (`layout.js`), page component (`index.js`), or `gatsby-browser.js`.

```javascript
import "@fontsource/combo" // Defaults to weight 400.
```

Fontsource allows you to select weights and even individual styles, allowing you to cut down on payload sizes to the last byte! Utilizing the CSS unicode-range selector, all language subsets are accounted for.

```javascript
import "@fontsource/combo/500.css" // Weight 500.
import "@fontsource/combo/900-italic.css" // Italic variant.
```

Alternatively, the same solutions could be imported via SCSS!

```scss
@import "~@fontsource/combo/index.css"; // Weight 400.
@import "~@fontsource/combo/300-italic.css";
```

For more advanced setups, you can use our highly customisable Sass mixins that can modify many of the existing @font-face variables.

```scss
@import "~@fontsource/combo/scss/mixins";

// Uses a unicode-range map to automatically generate multiple @font-face rules.
@include fontFace(
  $weight: 500,
  $display: fallback,
  $fontDir: "~@fontsource/combo/files"
);

// Fully customisable single @font-face mixin.
@include fontFaceCustom(
  $weight: 600,
  $display: optional,
  $woff2Path: "~@fontsource/combo/files/combo-latin-500-normal.woff2",
  $unicodeRange: false
);
// More options available in link below.
```

You can see all of the existing inputtable mixin variables [here](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/tree/master/packages/combo/scss/mixins.scss).

_These examples may not reflect actual compatibility. Please refer below._

Supported variables:

- Weights: `[400]`
- Styles: `[normal]`

Finally, you can reference the font name in a CSS stylesheet, CSS Module, or CSS-in-JS.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Combo";
}
```

## Additional Options

In the rare case you need to individually select a language subset and not utilize the CSS unicode-range selector, you may specify the import as follows. This is especially not recommended for languages, such as Japanese, with a large amount of characters.

```javascript
import "@fontsource/combo/latin-ext.css" // All weights with normal style included.
import "@fontsource/combo/cyrillic-ext-500.css" // Weight 500 with normal style.
import "@fontsource/combo/greek-900-italic.css" // Italic variant.
```

- Supported subsets: `[latin,latin-ext]`

## Licensing

It is important to always read the license for every font that you use.
